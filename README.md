# Fake Job Detection 🕵️‍♂️

A machine learning project designed to detect fraudulent job postings using real-world data.  
Built with Python, Scikit-learn, Streamlit, and other popular data science tools.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Fake job postings can deceive job seekers and waste valuable time and resources.  
This project leverages machine learning techniques to classify job listings as **fake** or **real** based on various features.

The project includes:
- **Data cleaning** and **preprocessing** of a Kaggle job posting dataset.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to uncover key patterns in fake listings.
- **Model building** using multiple classification algorithms.
- A **Streamlit web application** for real-time fake job detection.

---

## 🚀 Technologies Used
- **Python 3**
- **Scikit-learn**
- **Pandas**
- **NumPy**
- **Matplotlib**
- **Seaborn**
- **Streamlit**

---

## 📊 Features
- Analyze and predict whether a job posting is real or fake.
- Interactive **Streamlit** app for quick job description analysis.
- Visualizations showing trends and correlations in fraudulent postings.
- Achieved **95%+ model accuracy** on test data.
